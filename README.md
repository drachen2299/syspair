# Project Overview

## Project Name

Syspair

## Project Description

A comparison app - simulare to these examples: [Stack](http://gpuboss.com/compare-gpus), [gmuarena](https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3). That will compare technologies i.e. (server envoriments/operating systems/networking infurctructure etc). with programming languages, and their key features, speed, tranferability - and show you the highest rated/or most used in each case.

The user will submit a survey, the date will be aggregated with data on the database(this is optional)

## Additional Technologies

- CSS Tailwind
- Graph.js
- BF4
- Next.js
- Visx

## MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Wireframes and general mobile first layout
- Setup Python backend with flask/peewee including routes models DB server
- Seed data and account for full CRUD from bottom to top
- Setup next.js with services and routes, components and navigation
- Design form to delete and edit user generated content
- Style via tailwind
- Deploy to Heroku/Netlify (Wednesday Nov 3rd)
#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add full functionality scraper tool
- Expand the category charts to display more data when clicked into
- Add the ability to make the search dynamic via the scraper 
- List all technologies on the front page via pie charts for mobile and services

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## SWOT Analysis

#### Strengths:
- I think Ill be comfortable not taking to much on at once, sticking to the goal of getting everything working to how I envision it and then the complicated stuff after 

#### Weaknesses:
- Relatively new to tailwind and next so could take some getting used to 

#### Opportunities:
- using new frameworks gives me the chance to challenge my self and stay on target
#### Threats:
- May take a bit to learn Tailwind and Next but Im confident the challenge and the scope of my project will be within the bounds of this week
